# Defold Explosion 

This is a little demo made for the defold challenge here:

https://forum.defold.com/t/community-challenge-explosions/77315/25

Lots of things I wanted to do, heres some of them:
- The explosion was going to have millions of particles (I might still do this). But there are limitations on the numbers of GO's and they are not really ideal for this method.
- A nuclear explosion with a mushroom cloud was going to be physically modelled (there is some in there), with thermal propagation, air resitiance and more. I might still do this, since its an interesting physics fluid dynamics model. 
- Mesh deformation rather than particles. Not sure if this is possible - might work better with voxels or similar.
- Some nice smoke particles as well. 

Not sure if I will revisit this. 

License is all MIT. Use it as you like in your own projects. There is included:
- Sky rendering shader 
- Camera orbit script - its a very simple one, if thats what you need :)
- Some transform utilities (like camera lookats and so on)

Feel free to hack away with this.
